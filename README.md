# First-Bank

Using java this project was made as a simple banking simulation in which users could
deposit or withdraw currency, update their name, or check their balance.
Before gaining any access to those privileges however, the user would have to log in using a PIN.
The amount of money as well as the user's information would then be saved upon ending the program and would
return upon restarting the program.
This project was intended to be a basic introdution into java.
